# MIS-012: Eternal Vigilance Expansion - Coverage Ascension to 85%

## Mission Overview
Expand unit test coverage from 81.4% to 85% by implementing comprehensive test suites for remaining components with the lowest coverage. Focus on strengthening the fortress of auto-preservation through rigorous testing of critical prediction and ethical evaluation modules.

## Target Components

### 1. Prediction Engine Modules (Current: ~75% → Target: 90%)
**Criticality:** High - Core of Praevisio's predictive capabilities

**Coverage Gaps Identified:**
- Advanced prediction algorithms (lines with complex logic)
- Error handling in data processing
- Integration with external APIs
- Ethical vector calculations

**Required Test Cases:**
- Prediction accuracy validation
- Error boundary testing
- API integration mocking
- Ethical assessment computations
- Data transformation pipelines

### 2. Frontend Components with Low Coverage (Current: <80% → Target: 90%)
**Criticality:** High - User interface reliability

**Coverage Gaps Identified:**
- Interactive components (buttons, forms)
- State management edge cases
- Loading and error states
- Accessibility features

**Required Test Cases:**
- User interaction simulations
- State transition testing
- Error handling in UI
- Accessibility compliance
- Performance under load

### 3. Backend Services (Current: ~80% → Target: 90%)
**Criticality:** High - Data integrity and API reliability

**Coverage Gaps Identified:**
- Database operations
- External service integrations
- Authentication flows
- Data validation

**Required Test Cases:**
- CRUD operations testing
- Integration with third-party APIs
- Security validation
- Performance benchmarks

## Success Criteria
- **Coverage Targets:**
  - Overall system: ≥85% statements, ≥80% branches, ≥85% functions, ≥85% lines
  - Critical components: ≥90% coverage
  - No component below 80% coverage

- **Quality Assurance:**
  - All tests pass in native development environment
  - Zero regression in existing functionality
  - Comprehensive mocking for external dependencies
  - Test execution time < 5 seconds
  - E2E tests maintain 100% pass rate

## Implementation Strategy
1. Analyze current coverage report to identify low-coverage files
2. Prioritize critical components for testing
3. Create comprehensive test suites with mocking
4. Implement integration tests for API endpoints
5. Validate coverage improvements iteratively
6. Ensure test maintainability and performance

## Risk Mitigation
- Use proper mocking to avoid real network calls and database operations
- Test error conditions and fallbacks thoroughly
- Maintain SSR compatibility in tests
- Follow existing test patterns and conventions
- Implement parallel test execution for speed

## Timeline
- Implementation: Systematic coverage expansion
- Validation: Continuous coverage monitoring
- Completion: 90% coverage achieved and committed

## Strategic Impact
Achieving 90% test coverage will establish Praevisio AI as a fortress of reliability, ensuring zero-tolerance regression and enabling confident autonomous evolution. This mission strengthens the eternal vigilance required for sovereign operation.
