# MIS-009: Quantum Coverage Expansion - Fortress Enhancement to 80%

## Mission Overview
Expand unit test coverage from 70.98% to 80% by implementing comprehensive test suites for critical components with the lowest coverage. Focus on MetatronPanel.tsx and MetatronPanelWidget.tsx to strengthen the core operational interface.

## Target Components

### 1. MetatronPanel.tsx (Current: 43.61% → Target: 85%)
**Criticality:** High - Core operational interface for Aion's eternal vigilance system

**Coverage Gaps Identified:**
- Error handling in dynamic imports (lines 22-28, 35-38)
- EventSource setup and SSE connection logic (lines 57-85)
- State management and effects (lines 95-100, 105-114, 119)
- Component rendering and prop passing

**Required Test Cases:**
- Component renders without crashing
- Dynamic import error handling
- EventSource connection establishment
- SSE message parsing and state updates
- Toggle vigilance functionality
- Emit message handling
- Download report functionality
- State synchronization with simulator
- Cleanup on unmount

### 2. MetatronPanelWidget.tsx (Current: 40% → Target: 80%)
**Criticality:** High - Primary widget for Metatron operations display

**Coverage Gaps Identified:**
- Risk color calculation logic (lines 29-33)
- Risk indices rendering (lines 74-144)
- Activity feed display
- Control button interactions
- SSE status display

**Required Test Cases:**
- Component renders with default props
- Risk level color mapping
- Risk indices display for multiple countries
- Activity feed rendering with different flow types
- SSE connection status display
- Toggle vigilance button states
- Emit message input handling
- Download button functionality
- Event list rendering

## Success Criteria
- **Coverage Targets:**
  - MetatronPanel.tsx: ≥85% statements, ≥80% branches, ≥75% functions, ≥85% lines
  - MetatronPanelWidget.tsx: ≥80% statements, ≥75% branches, ≥70% functions, ≥80% lines
  - Overall system: ≥80% statements

- **Quality Assurance:**
  - All tests pass in native development environment
  - Zero regression in existing functionality
  - Comprehensive mocking for external dependencies
  - Clean test execution (< 2 seconds)

## Implementation Strategy
1. Create `src/pages/__tests__/MetatronPanel.test.tsx`
2. Create `src/components/metatron/__tests__/MetatronPanelWidget.test.tsx`
3. Implement mocks for EventSource, fetch, and simulator functions
4. Test component rendering, user interactions, and state management
5. Validate coverage improvements with `npx jest --coverage`

## Risk Mitigation
- Use proper mocking to avoid real network calls
- Test error conditions and fallbacks
- Ensure SSR compatibility in tests
- Maintain existing test patterns and conventions

## Timeline
- Implementation: Immediate execution
- Validation: Post-implementation coverage check
- Completion: Coverage targets achieved and committed
